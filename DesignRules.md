# The core set of Design Rules

## Resources

The REST architectural style is centered around the concept of a [=resource=]. A resource is the key abstraction of information, where every piece of information is named by assigning a globally unique [=URI=] (Uniform Resource Identifier). Resources describe *things*, which can vary between physical objects (e.g. a building or a person) and more abstract concepts (e.g. a permit or an event).

   <p class="rulelab">Use nouns to name resources</p>
   <dl>
   <dt>Statement</dt>
   <dd>
   Resources are referred to using nouns (instead of verbs) that are relevant from the perspective of the user of the API.   
   <div class="example">
      A few correct examples of nouns as part of a URI:

      </ul>
      <p>This is different than RPC-style APIs, where verbs are often used to perform certain actions:</p>
      <ul>

</dl>
</div>

A resource describing a single thing is called a [=singular resource=]. Resources can also be grouped into collections, which are resources in their own right and can typically be paged, sorted and filtered. Most often all collection members have the same type, but this is not necessarily the case. A resource describing multiple things is called a [=collection resource=]. Collection resources typically contain references to the underlying singular resources.

         A collection resource represents multiple things.
      </dd>
      <dt>Rationale</dt>
      <dd>
         The path segment describing the name of the collection resource MUST be written in the plural form.
         <div class="example">
            <p>Example collection resources, describing a list of things:</p>

         </div>
         <p>Singular resources contained within a collection resource are generally named by appending a path segment for the identification of each individual resource.</p>
         <div class="example">
            <p>Example singular resource, contained within a collection resource:</p>
            <pre>https://api.example.org/v1/gebouwen/3b9710c4-6614-467a-ab82-36822cf48db1<br/>https://api.example.org/v1/vergunningen/d285e05c-6b01-45c3-92d8-5e19a946b66f</pre>

         <p>Singular resources that stand on their own, i.e. which are not contained within a collection resource, MUST be named with a path segment that is written in the singular form.</p>

         The exact meaning of concepts is often lost in translation. Publishing an API for an international audience might also be a reason to define interfaces in English.

         A [=URI=] MUST never contain a trailing slash. When requesting a resource including a trailing slash, this MUST result in a `404` (not found) error response and not a redirect. This enforces API consumers to use the correct [=URI=].
      </dd>

         Leaving off trailing slashes, and not implementing a redirect, enforces API consumers to use the correct URI. This avoids confusion and ambiguity.

## HTTP methods

Although the REST architectural style does not impose a specific protocol, REST APIs are typically implemented using HTTP [[rfc7231]].

<span id="api-03"></span>
<div class="rule" id="/core/http-methods" data-type="technical">
   <p class="rulelab">Only apply standard HTTP methods</p>

         Resources MUST be retrieved or manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE).
      </dd>
      <dt>Rationale</dt>
      <dd>
         The HTTP specifications offer a set of standard methods, where every method is designed with explicit semantics. Adhering to the HTTP specification is crucial, since HTTP clients and middleware applications rely on standardized characteristics.

      <dt>Rationale</dt>
      <dd>
         The HTTP protocol [[rfc7231]] specifies whether an HTTP method SHOULD be considered safe and/or idempotent. These characteristics are important for clients and middleware applications, because they SHOULD be taken into account when implementing caching and fault tolerance strategies.
      </dd>
      <dt>Implications</dt>
      <dd>
         Request methods are considered <i>safe</i> if their defined semantics are essentially read-only; i.e., the client does not request, and does not expect, any state change on the origin server as a result of applying a safe method to a target resource. A request method is considered <i>idempotent</i> if the intended effect on the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same as the effect for a single such request.
      </dd>
   </dl>
</div>


## Statelessness

One of the key constraints of the REST architectural style is stateless communication between client and server. It means that every request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request. The server cannot take advantage of any stored session context on the server as it didn’t memorize previous requests. Session state must therefore reside entirely on the client.

To properly understand this constraint, it's important to make a distinction between two different kinds of state:
* *Session state*: information about the interactions of an end user with a particular client application within the same user session, such as the last page being viewed, the login state or form data in a multi-Step registration process. Session state must reside entirely on the client (e.g. in the user's browser).
* *Resource state*: information that is permanently stored on the server beyond the scope of a single user session, such as the user's profile, a product purchase or information about a building. Resource state is persisted on the server and must be exchanged between client and server (in both directions) using  representations as part of the request or response payload. This is actually where the term *REpresentational State Transfer (REST)* originates from.

<p class="note">It's a misconception that there should be no state at all. The stateless communication constraint should be seen from the server's point of view and states that the server should not be aware of any <em>session state</em>.</p>

Stateless communication offers many advantages, including:
* *Simplicity* is increased because the server doesn't have to memorize or retrieve session state while processing requests
* *Scalability* is improved because not having to incorporate session state across multiple requests enables higher concurrency and performance
* *Observability* is improved since every request can be monitored or analyzed in isolation without having to incorporate session context from other requests
* *Reliability* is improved because it eases the task of recovering from partial failures since the server doesn't have to maintain, update or communicate session state. One failing request does not influence other requests (depending on the nature of the failure of course).

      <dd>
         To achieve full decoupling between client and server, and to benefit from the advantages mentioned above, no session state MUST reside on the server. Session state MUST therefore reside entirely on the client.

## Relationships

Resources are often interconnected by relationships. Relationships can be modelled in different ways depending on the cardinality, semantics and more importantly, the use cases and access patterns the REST API needs to support.

<span id="api-06"></span>
<div class="rule" id="/core/nested-child" data-type="functional">
  <p class="rulelab">Use nested URIs for child resources</p>
  <dl>
      <dt>Statement</dt>
      <dd>
         When having a child resource which can only exist in the context of a parent resource, the [=URI=] SHOULD be nested.
      </dd>
      <dt>Rationale</dt>
      <dd>
         In this use case, the child resource does not necessarily have a top-level collection resource. The best way to explain this design rule is by example.
      </dd>
    <div class="example">
    <p>When modelling resources for a news platform including the ability for users to write comments, it might be a good strategy to model the [=collection resources=] hierarchically:</p>
    <pre>https://api.example.org/v1/articles/123/comments</pre>
    <p>The platform might also offer a photo section, where the same commenting functionality is offered. In the same way as for articles, the corresponding sub-collection resource might be published at:</p>
    <pre>https://api.example.org/v1/photos/456/comments</pre>
    <p>These nested sub-collection resources can be used to post a new comment (<code>POST</code> method) and to retrieve a list of comments (<code>GET</code> method) belonging to the parent resource, i.e. the article or photo. An important consideration is that these comments could never have existed without the existence of the parent resource.</p>
    <p>From the consumer's perspective, this approach makes logical sense, because the most obvious use case is to show comments below the parent article or photo (e.g. on the same web page) including the possibility to paginate through the comments. The process of posting a comment is separate from the process of publishing a new article. Another client use case might also be to show a global <em>latest comments</em> section in the sidebar. For this use case, an additional resource could be provided:</p>
    <pre>https://api.example.org/v1/comments</pre>
    <p>If this would have not been a meaningful use case, this resource should not exist at all. Because it doesn't make sense to post a new comment from a global context, this resource would be read-only (only <code>GET</code> method is supported) and may possibly provide a more compact representation than the parent-specific sub-collections.</p>
    <p>The [=singular resources=] for comments, referenced from all 3 collections, could still be modelled on a higher level to avoid deep nesting of URIs (which might increase complexity or problems due to the URI length):</p>
    <pre>https://api.example.org/v1/comments/123<br />https://api.example.org/v1/comments/456</pre>
    <p>Although this approach might seem counterintuitive from a technical perspective (we simply could have modelled a single <code>/comments</code> resource with optional filters for article and photo) and might introduce partially redundant functionality, it makes perfect sense from the perspective of the consumer, which increases developer experience.</p>

         Model resource operations as a sub-resource or dedicated resource</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Rationale</dt>
      <dd>
         There are resource operations which might not seem to fit well in the CRUD interaction model. For example, approving of a submission or notifying a customer. Depending on the type of the operation, there are three possible approaches:
      <ol>
         <li>Re-model the resource to incorporate extra fields supporting the particular operation. For example, an approval operation can be modelled in a boolean attribute <code>goedgekeurd</code> that can be modified by issuing a <code>PATCH</code> request against the resource. Drawback of this approach is that the resource does not contain any metadata about the operation (when and by whom was the approval given? Was the submission declined in an earlier stage?). Furthermore, this requires a fine-grained authorization model, since approval might require a specific role.</li>
         <li>Treat the operation as a sub-resource. For example, model a sub-collection resource <code>/inzendingen/12/beoordelingen</code> and add an approval or declination by issuing a <code>POST</code> request. To be able to retrieve the review history (and to consistently adhere to the REST principles), also support the <code>GET</code> method for this resource. The <code>/inzendingen/12</code> resource might still provide a <code>goedgekeurd</code> boolean attribute (same as approach 1) which gets automatically updated on the background after adding a review. This attribute SHOULD however be read-only.</li>
         <li>In exceptional cases, the approaches above still don't offer an appropriate solution. An example of such an operation is a global search across multiple resources. In this case, the creation of a dedicated resource, possibly nested under an existing resource, is the most obvious solution. Use the imperative mood of a verb, maybe even prefix it with a underscore to distinguish these resources from regular resources. For example: <code>/search</code> or <code>/_search</code>. Depending on the operation characteristics, <code>GET</code> and/or <code>POST</code> method MAY be supported for such a resource.</li>

## Documentation

An API is as good as the accompanying documentation. The documentation has to be easily findable, searchable and publicly accessible. Most developers will first read the documentation before they start implementing. Hiding the technical documentation in PDF documents and/or behind a login creates a barrier for both developers and search engines.

      </dd>
      <dt>Rationale</dt>
      <dd>
         The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) [[OPENAPIS]] defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
         API documentation MUST be provided in the form of an OpenAPI definition document which conforms to the OpenAPI Specification (from v3 onwards). As a result, a variety of tools can be used to render the documentation (e.g. Swagger UI or ReDoc) or automate tasks such as testing or code generation. The OAS document SHOULD provide clear descriptions and examples.

Changes in APIs are inevitable. APIs should therefore always be versioned, facilitating the transition between changes.

         Managing change is important. In general, well documented and timely communicated deprecation schedules are the most important for API users. When deprecating features or versions, a deprecation schedule MUST be published. This document SHOULD be published on a public web page. Furthermore, active clients SHOULD be informed by e-mail once the schedule has been updated or when versions have reached end-of-life.

         Version numbering MUST follow the Semantic Versioning [[SemVer]] model to prevent breaking changes when releasing new API versions. Release versions are formatted using the <code>major.minor.patch</code> template (examples: 1.0.2, 1.11.0). Pre-release versions MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers (examples: 1.0.2-rc.1, 2.0.0-beta.3). When releasing a new version which contains backwards-incompatible changes, a new major version MUST be released. Minor and patch releases MAY only contain backwards compatible changes (e.g. the addition of an endpoint or an optional attribute).

      The [[[ADR-TS]]] MUST be applied.

    <dt>Rationale</dt>
    <dd>
      The [[[ADR-TS]]] formalizes three rules to apply to APIs:
      <ol>
        <li>Secure connections using TLS</li>
        <li>No sensitive information in URIs</li>
        <li>Use CORS to control access</li>
      </ol>
      Furthermore, the module describes best practices for security headers, browser-based applications, and other HTTP configurations. These best practices MUST be considered and the considerations SHOULD be published in the API documentation. Transport security is the baseline for REST API resources and the data concerned is a vital asset of the government. The rules and best practices are considered the minimal security principles, concepts and technologies to apply.
